# Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)

Help people to identify and gain some understanding round:

- How they take in information and make decisions
- The patterns of [perception and judgment](#perception-and-judgment)

as seen in normal, healthy behavior.

It also has a role in relationship building (awareness, communication, and planning).

## Perception and judgment

Perception and judgment describe how people prefer to use their minds. They reflect one's:

- Characteristics
- Behavior
- Interests
- Reactions
- Values
- Motivations

## Preference pairs

- Extraversion (E) and Introversion (I): ways to direct and receive energy
- Sensing (S) and Intuition (N): ways to take in information
- Thinking (T) and Feeling (F): ways to decide and come to conclusions
- Judging (J) and Perceiving (P): ways to approach the outside world

## Innate vs learned preferences

- Type theory: personality type preferences are innate
- Type does not dictate behavior
- With awareness, we can use opposite preferences
