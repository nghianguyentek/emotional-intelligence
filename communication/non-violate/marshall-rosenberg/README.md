# Marshall Rosenberg

(1934-2015)

Founder and Director of Educational Services for the Center of Nonviolent Communication (CNVC)

- "At the core of all anger is a need that is not being fulfilled."
- "Violences creates violences"
- "Making life wonderful" instead of "Who's right?" game

## "Who's right?" game

"Punishment" & "reward"

- Violence enjoyable
- Create a pain on top another pain

## Facts

- Natural desired to give
- Express your gratitude: What they did and how wonderful we felt about it and how we would use it.
- Stay in your heart and connect to your needs

## Language of needs

- Needs are no reference, therefore they are quite different from preferences. 
- Pure needs are our own needs without related to anyone else.

### Needs

- to be heard
- to be understood
- to be loved

## Empathically hearing others

What they are feeling when saying that?

Guess their needs through their feelings

See through the windows of thoughts and words
