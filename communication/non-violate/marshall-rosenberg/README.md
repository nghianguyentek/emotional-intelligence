# Marshall Rosenberg

natural desired to give

violence enjoyable

create a pain on top another pain

Express your gratitude: What they did and how wonderful we felt about it and how we would use it.

Stay in your heart and connect to your needs

Violences creates violences.

## Language of needs

- Needs are no reference, therefore they are quite different from preferences. 
- Pure needs are our own needs without related to anyone else.

### Needs

- to be heard
- to be understood
- to be loved

## Empathically hearing others

What they are feeling when saying that?

Guess their needs through their feelings

See through the windows of thoughts and words
