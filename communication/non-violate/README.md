# Non Violent Communication

About assertive and empathic communication

## Violent communication

Judgements make our communication "violent". But it's not possible not to make judgements.

Violence communication:

- Critical, negative, and evaluative.
- Superior position and talking down

## Steps

- Observation
- Feeling
- Need
- Request

## Observations

## Reduce passing judgements

- According to me ...
- This is how I perceive you ...

## Feelings

The cause of our feelings is not another person, but rather our own thoughts, wants, and wishes. For example, we become
angry because of the thoughts we are having, not because of anything other person has done for us.

Violence, whether verbal or physical, is the result of assuming that our feelings are caused not by what is going on
inside us but rather by what is going on "out there".

I'm angry because my expectations have not been met.
