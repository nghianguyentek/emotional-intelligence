# Empathy in NVC

The second part of NVC: the process of connecting with another by guessing their feelings and needs

in the form of a question

If all parties empathically connect at the level of feelings and needs, a transformation often happens in which one or more parties experience a shift in intention and attention -> creative solution, including changing needs.

Those are moments of deep human connection, satisfaction, and hope.
