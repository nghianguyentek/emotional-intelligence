# Feedback

Feedback is the transmission of evaluative or corrective information about an action, event, or process to the original or controlling source (Merriam-Webster) or the information so transmitted.

Feedback is the response information used to compare the actual result and its desired one.

Feedback is about future improvements

Feedback is "a process in which the factors that produce a result are themselves modified, corrected, strengthened, etc. by that result" and "a response, as one that sets such a process in motion"
