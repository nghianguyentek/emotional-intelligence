# Corrections

## Recast correction

The teacher's reformulation of all or part of a student's utterance, minus the error.

## Elicitation correction

refers to at least three techniques that teachers use to directly elicit the correct form from the student: "fill in the blank", disagreement, or repeating the error.

## Metalinguistic correction

either comments, information, or questions related to the well-formedness of the student's utterance, without explicitly providing the correct form.
