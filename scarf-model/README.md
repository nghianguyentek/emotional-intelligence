# SCARF Model

Dr. David Rock

Easy way to remember and act upon the social triggers that generate both the approach and avoid responses. The goal of this model is to help minimize the easily activated threat responses, and maximize positive engaged states of mind during attempts to collaborate with and influence others (Rock, 2008).

## Minimize Danger - Maximize Reward principle

One brain organization principle (Gordon, 2000)

Analogous the approach-avoid response, especially in associated with survival

Brain is a network with two states:
- Minimize dangers/threats
- Maximize rewards

### Minimize danger

### Maximize reward

## Carrot and stick

## SCARF

What is driving one's behaviours?

- Status: perception of your position in a relation to others
- Certainty
- Autonomy
- Relatedness
- Fairness

## Implications

- Self-management
- Education & training
- Coaching
- Leadership development
- Organize systems

## Status

### Treat sources

- Giving advice/instruction/feedback/suggestion
- Performance review

Solution: Avoid "you could do something better" and use self-feedback to get rid of the threatened feelings instead

### Reward sources

- Compliment/praise improvement
- Positive feedback such as public acknowledgement
- Promotions

## Certainty

The brain is a pattern-recognition machine trying to predict what's going to happen next.

Uncertainty generates forced-attention errors in the orbital frontal cortex (OFC)

Reduce uncertainty

### Treat sources

- Unclear objectives/targets/plans
- Changes

### Reward sources

- Clear objectives
- Change management

## Autonomy

Environment control + Permission to make decisions or a sensation of having choices

Reduce stress

### Threat sources

- Being micromanaged

### Reward sources

- Having choices
- Personal desk, flexible working time & place

## Relatedness

Friend or foe and closely related to trust

Create bonding (handshake, exchange name cards, discuss common grounds) release oxytocin. 

Alcohol or oxytocin may help to reduce relatedness threat response.

### Threat sources

- Global environments, different cultures

### Reward sources

- Establish small groups for sharing, learning, and playing together

## Fairness

Treat people open and fairly

Unfair exchanges generate strong threat response.

### Threat source

- Different treatments (working hours, salary, headcount)

### Reward source

- Clear expectations
- Reduce a slight amount of senior executive during a difficult time can be a long-term strategy
