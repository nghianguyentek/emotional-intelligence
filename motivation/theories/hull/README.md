# Hull's Drive Theory

Clark Hull early 1990s

Kurt Lewin + Edward Tolman

Partly derived from laws of learning
- Law of Effective

Habits are the reinforcement providing the necessary grounding for the establishment of stimulus-response connections.

## The Drive Concept

Behaviour = Drive x Habit

## Law of Effective

(Thorndike, 1911)

When a stimulus-response bond is followed by a satisfying state of affairs, the bond strength increases. Conversely, if it is followed by an annoying state, the bond strength decreases (is weakened).


"Example is leadership." - Albert Schweitzer.

This quote is exactly the core of the leadership strategy I have followed. It means that one should be an example or able to give a clear example for others to follow, especially what they want others to do. By doing that, I can show them clearly the object (or target) and a possible way (or direction) (not need to be the best one) to achieve that. To have that example, I need to find or experience it. That means I somehow collaborate with them directly or indirectly. If I have no experience with the problem, it would be my opportunity to improve myself. In this process, its difficulties might leverage a good base for me to help others and empathise with them. Of course, this also improves my estimation and planning skills, which are essential in leadership. It's worth noting that I don't need to do my own to get an example in all cases; for example, I can learn from others. By the way, the crucial need for building a good network is nondisputed. Since I can present that example in whatever forms are most suitable for others and me, I can walk around the limit of my verbal communication. Another good aspect of this is I don't need to imagine something on the fly and then put all improvisation
