# Social Intelligence (SI)

*Also Interpersonal Intelligence*

Social Intelligence, measured by [Social Quotient (SQ)](social-quotient.md#some-hallmarks-of-sq), is the ability to understand and manage people and to act wisely in human relations.

Intelligence is a complex hierarchy of information-processing skills underlying an adaptive equilibrium between the individual and the environment. An individual can therefore change their [Social Quotient (SQ)](social-quotient.md#social-quotient-sq) by altering their attitudes and behaviour in response to their environment.
