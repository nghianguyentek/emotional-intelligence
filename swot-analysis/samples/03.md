# Sample 03 - Personal Well-Being & Academic Success 

## My Strengths

My strengths would be resilience and empathy. When it comes to resilience, having faced and survived repeated trauma, I’ve developed a resilience that can be a significant strength in academic and personal challenges. When it comes to empathy, emotional contagion research suggests that individuals who experience intense emotions may be more attuned to the emotions of others. This potentially leads to high levels of empathy. (US Department of Veteran Affairs)

## My Weaknesses

My weaknesses would be emotional regulation and concentration. When it comes to emotional regulation, the difficulty can be a challenge especially in stressful academic settings. When it comes down to concentration, the symptoms of CPTSD may include difficulties with concentration that can impact my academic performance.

## My Opportunities

My opportunities would be supporting networks and academic accommodations. When it comes to having support networks, building a support network with peers, counselors, and educators who understand CPTSD can provide a nurturing environment for growth for me. As far as academic accommodation is concerned, having that can provide the necessary support to manage coursework and deadlines effectively. (Lightfully Behavorial Health)

## My Threats

My threats would be stressful environments and misunderstanding from others. When it comes to stressful environments, high-pressure academic environments can exacerbate CPTSD symptoms. This can pose a threat to mental well-being and academic success. As far as the misunderstanding from others, Lack of awareness about CPTSD among peers and faculty can lead to misunderstandings and additional stress.
